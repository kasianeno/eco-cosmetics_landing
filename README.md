DESCRIPTION

This project is a modern, responsive landing page designed using HTML and CSS. The page is crafted to be visually appealing while maintaining simplicity and ease of navigation. It features a clean layout with a focus on user experience and user interface principles, ensuring that content is accessible and engaging across all devices.

For that landing page project using SASS is a more advanced web development task that focuses on building a responsive and visually appealing website. SASS, a CSS preprocessor, enhances the project by making the code more organized, maintainable, and scalable.

Key sections of the landing page typically include a hero area with a strong headline and CTA(call-to-action), sections with information about brand, creators and product, shop section, simple form for customers to help them chosing a product and a footer with contact information and social media links. Using SASS allows for efficient styling with variables, and mixins, which streamline the CSS process and ensure design consistency.

Overall, this project showcases the ability to create a polished, responsive landing page while leveraging the power of SASS for better code management.
